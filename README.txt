this project will show particle physics

the spheres will initially oscillate inwards and outwards and all have very specific placements on the imagined larger sphere they are outlining

would like to implement some sort of impact explosion so I'm thinking that mouse click would create a sphere individual from the oscillating ones that when impacting the oscillating spheres - triggers an explosion of very small particles (with random velocity and direction) that dissapate over time. also on impact the oscillating sphere that was hit will disappear and the mouse sphere will continue to bounce

steps:
1. create oscillating spheres
2. create mouse clicked sphere with bounce logic
3. create particle explosion and disappearing act
